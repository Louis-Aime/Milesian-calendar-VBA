Function DATE_PARSE(TheCell As String) As Date 'A String is converted into a Date
Attribute DATE_PARSE.VB_Description = "Extract date and time value from string. Standard or Milesian expression. Earliest is Greg. 1/1/100. Fix bug for Date-time expressions before 1900."
'TheCell holds a valid string for a date, either in milesian, either in a specific calendar,
'or in the standard calendar (gregorian).
'TheCell is supposed a numeric date string. It shall not work with months expressed by their names.
'Summary:
'   1. Prepare, convert all in uppercase, trim
'   2. Extract calendar indication when available.
'   3. Extract Time part, store in T
'   4. Split Date part into minimum 2 elements
'   5. Find Month element after its pattern ("M" month marker)
'   6. Find Year element, of provide present year
'   7. Find Day element of provide "1" by default, return
'   Note: authorised delimiters are "./-". Comma is dropped. m of Milesian month is recognised. Other lead to error.
'   If as first character: canvas is yyy/mm/dd or similar, even M-yyy-mm-dd is possible.
'   If not as first, find and extract "m", compute d, m and year elements, call MILESIAN_DATE.

'1. Prepare: Convert string to Uppercase and drop blanks in excess
Dim Elem, I    'Eleme: the array of elements of TheCell when splitted, I: a standard index
Dim T As Date, Y, M, D    'The date elements
Dim Yindex, Mindex, Dindex    'Index of year, month and day in Elem, -1 means "unknown"
Dim Delimiters      'The list of possible delimiters (outside " ")
Delimiters = Array("/", ".", "-")

TheCell = Trim(TheCell) 'Suppress all leading and trailing blank
TheCell = UCase(TheCell) 'All uppercase
'For Open Office: Drop initial "'"
If Left(TheCell, 1) = "'" Then TheCell = Right(TheCell, Len(TheCell) - 1)

'2. Did the user specify the calendar with the first character ?
